PHASE 1

Got standard Gaussian EM working, seemingly prety well on the points.dat, as well as the 
built in test data.

Will next remove the memory and calculation inefficiencies.

Then will benchmark.

Then, will vectorize.

Then will benchmark.

Then will port to gnumpy.

Then will benchmark.

Then possibly will use python parallel processes.

---------------------------------------
PHASE 2

add HMM training to the fastest mechanism.

---------------------------------------
PHASE 3

Implement the dual HMM model using CERT data.



when running:

    python -O mm.py

the -O causes asserts and debug ifs to not be executed
